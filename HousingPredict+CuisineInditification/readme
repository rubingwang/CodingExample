This folder contains part of the coding of the final course project in Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World. 
The final project contains four different tasks: structure data, image data, text data, and social network data. 
For my part, I conducted the first two tasks: a housing pricing primitive model (assignment 1) and an image identification model (assignment 2). 

However, the code for assignment 1 is missing. I could not save them then; I just kept the result and the figure.
You can check the report in the pdf file.
