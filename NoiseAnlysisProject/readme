This folder contains part of the coding of the final course project in Modern Data Analysis.
The final paper aims to model the features of noise information of Leuven (in Belgium) in 2020 and deliver a noise-predictive model.
Much information is collected because noise generation may be related to students’ daily routines, store opening hours, car traffic, pedestrian screams, rain sounds, humidity, temperature, etc.
All noise information is contained in three CSV files (export40/41/42), and the weather information is contained in the CSV file since the weather can also influence the noise factors. 
In the project, I also add some extra university calendar events. 

Thus, the ipynb files 1-5 are their processing steps. 
The ipynb 6 is the code for exploratory analysis.
The ipynb 7 is the code for precessing the variable name and variables’ setup, etc.
The ipynb 8 is the code for model training and feature engineering to select the optional variables for the model.
